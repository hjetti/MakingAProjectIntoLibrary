# Sample Import succeded...Hurray... Disclaimer : please check the screenshots and then proceed to study. DONT directly mess up with the code. First screenshots, readme and then code.

If you want to understand the beauty, just download this SampleImport and open it with android studio. Then run it in your mobile, bingooo....

* I have basically created a sample app, that has a button and this itself is one project which is independent (NO OTHER LIBRARIES OR FILE).
* Later i have added the .aar (AAR library file) file, into this SampleImport project, and made a few notable changes in gradle which i have explained as earlier.
* I have only ONE SINGLE ACTIVITY in SampleImport named as MainActivity that has a button, which upon clicking will take you to the MapsActivity in the library.(.aar file)
* The great thing here is our library is working, it doesnt even have any maps activity or something, but we can use this small file and import it wherever we want.
* I have uploaded the code, screenshot. First check the screenshots to get a clear picture.
